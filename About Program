UBI_TOOL

The program identifies Potential Ubiquitination(ubi) sites from primary sequence of the protein.
It uses amino acid features obtained from 3D and 2D environment of experimentally known ubi sites  and weightages are given based on the results from signficance tests.
Each lysine in the protein sequence is extracted and its 19 Amino acids flanking on either sides are considered. Weightages are calculated for the surrounding amino acids.
The ones with highest scores are predicted to be potential ubiquitnation sites.
