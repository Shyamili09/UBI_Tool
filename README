The program identifies Potential Ubiquitination(ubi) sites from primary sequence of the protein.
It uses amino acid features obtained from 3D and 2D environment of experimentally known ubi sites  and weightage are given based on the results from significance tests.


Example Usage
=============
The program takes input as Fasta sequences in batch mode and scores each lysine based on its surrounding environmental amino acids

Running the script
=================

create a empty folder named "fasta_files" to store all the fasta files

In this example input file named as FASTA_INPUT.fasta

tcsh% python ubi_tool.py FASTA_INPUT.txt

The output can be seen in the file named ubiresults.txt
